# leap-c (Learning Predictive Control)

## Introduction

`leap-c` provides tools for learning optimal control policies using Imitation learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms. It is built on top of [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/), [acados](https://docs.acados.org/index.html) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## Installation

`leap-c` can be set up up by following the [installation guide](https://leap-c.github.io/leap-c/installation.html).
